                                I'm currently working as a TA for Data Structures and Algorithms. This has been a great experience so far. I'm able to increase my understanding of the subject by explaining it and it has also served as an opportunity to practice my communication skills. My duties include co-leading a lab section, constructing and grading assignments, and answering student questions in online Q&A boards or office hours.

                                This summer I interned at Trintech in Dallas. I was put on a team and quickly got to work. It was a wonderful experience, both the actual work and my coworkers. I mostly worked on an Angular project with Typescript and the corresponding Java EE backend. I developed several new features and implemented them both on the frontend and the backend. In the time between projects, I went through our bug backlog, cleared it, and kept it empty throughout the rest of the summer. Near the end, I containerized our IDP software to allow developers to easily run it on their computer.

                                During this internship, I was working with the IT team. I spent most of my time automating various tasks using Powershell. I also wrote a plugin for a Ruby application we were using. Additionally, I took our laptop configuration process and created a disk image and startup script which allowed us to receive ordered laptops pre-configured.

In <a href="https://ctftime.org/event/740">TAMUctf 2019</a>, I placed 1st in my bracket and 4th overall among TAMU students. I'm on the development team for TAMUctf 2020.

                                    I'm interested in emulation of old game systems and to a lesser extent old computers. I've built a functioning emulator for the Chip8 and I have finished the CPU on a Gameboy emulator (although that project is on hold right now). I frequently read papers on emulation development and look at the structure and design of existing emulators.  If you're interested in emulation, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyzD8pNlpwI">this</a> is a pretty neat talk on the subject.

                                    I spend a lot of time developing mods for games I enjoy playing. I have a handful of published mods and significantly more contributions to existing mods. My claim to fame is that one of my minecraft mods has slightly over a hundred thousand downloads.

                                    I love reading just about anything. I mostly read fiction (My favorite author is <a href="https://brandonsanderson.com/">Brandon Sanderson</a>) but I also like a good scientific paper or writeup.  <a href="https://www.evilsocket.net/2015/01/29/nike-fuelband-se-ble-protocol-reversed/">This</a> is a pretty fun read on reverse engineering the Nike Fuelband.
